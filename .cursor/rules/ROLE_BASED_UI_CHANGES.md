# Role-Based UI Changes Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the role-based UI visibility controls implemented in the Fitness App to restrict access to certain features based on user roles.

## Role Hierarchy
- **Athlete** (Level 1): Basic user role
- **Tester** (Level 2): Trainer role - can perform assessments
- **Admin** (Level 3): Administrator role
- **Super Admin** (Level 4): Highest level access

## Implemented Changes

### 1. For Athletes (Level 1)
**HIDDEN Elements:**
- ✅ Strength Assessment buttons (navbar & hero section)
- ✅ Speed Assessment buttons (navbar & hero section)  
- ✅ Agility Assessment buttons (navbar & hero section)
- ✅ Individual Results Filter in dashboard

**VISIBLE Elements:**
- ✅ Injury Form buttons
- ✅ Daily Tracking button
- ✅ Dashboard access
- ✅ Time Period Filter (for their own data)

### 2. For Trainers (Tester, Admin, Super Admin - Level 2+)
**HIDDEN Elements:**
- ✅ Injury Form buttons (navbar & hero section)
- ✅ Daily Tracking button in dashboard

**VISIBLE Elements:**
- ✅ All Assessment forms (Strength, Speed, Agility)
- ✅ Individual Results Filter
- ✅ Injury Reports button
- ✅ Dashboard access
- ✅ Time Period Filter

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files
- `public/src/app.js` - Updated `updateUIForRole()` function

### Key Changes Made
1. **Simplified Assessment Button Hiding**: Uses `querySelectorAll` to find all assessment buttons across navbar and hero sections
2. **Individual Results Filter**: Hides the membership filter container for athletes
3. **Injury Form Buttons**: Hides all injury form buttons for trainers
4. **Daily Tracking**: Hides daily tracking button for trainers

### Technical Approach
- Role-based visibility using CSS `display: none`
- Comprehensive button selection using CSS selectors
- Text content matching for precise targeting
- Maintains existing functionality while adding restrictions

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Login as different user roles
2. Verify hidden/visible elements match the specifications
3. Check both navbar and hero section buttons
4. Verify dashboard filters work correctly

## Security Note
This implementation provides UI-level restrictions only. Server-side access controls in `server.js` provide the actual security enforcement using role-based middleware.
